## Headers
To make a header you shoud use: "#". The more "#" you use, the lower the text is.<br>
For example:

# H1 title
## H2 title
### H3 title
Alternative H1 title
===
Alternative H2 title 
---


## Emphasis
To make a curve text you shoud use "* *" or "_ _"around the word or text.<br>
For example: *This is a curve text.*

To make a fat text you shoud use "** **" or "__ __"around the word or text.<br>
For example: **This is a fat text.**

To make a curve and fat text you shoud use "*** ***" around the word or text.<br>
For example: ***This is a curve and fat text.***

To make a scratch text you shoud use "~ ~" around the word or text.<br>
For example: ~~This is a scratched text.~~

## Lists
To make a list you can simply use "*", "+" or "-".<br>
For example:
* First element
- Second element
+ Third element

You can also use numbers.<br>
For example:
1. First element
2. Second element
3. Third element

You can also add text ander list by using spacebar 3 times.<br>
For example:
1. This is first element
   
   And this is text undernith it. Use it like like you want
2. This is third element

   And once again, feel free to write whatever you want.

You can make complex lists. Just use spacebar. And remember: list is numbered automatically.<br>
For example:
1. First element
   1. First sub-element
   1. Second sub-element
1. Second Element
   1. First sub-element
      * First element
        - Just
        + Stop
      * Second elemnt
    1. Second sub-elements.
